Labtronyx
=========

The Labtronyx project is a instrument control and automation framework. It
features a robust core for simplifying communication with laboratory instruments
and provides users with a powerful interface for controlling and automating
tests and experiments. Labtronyx is developed in Python to take advantage of the
powerful and vast collection of libraries, as well as to provide an easy to
learn environment in which to develop.

The goals of the Labtronyx project are:

   - Provide a framework for instrumentation that is easier to use (and cheaper)
     than MATLAB or LabVIEW.
     
   - Compatibility with any instrument from any vendor using any protocol.
   
   - Compatibility with Windows, Mac and Linux.
   
   - Powerful, object-oriented architecture that is flexible and easy to develop
   
Labtronyx is all you need to develop robust scripts and applications for
automation. With this framework, you will no longer have to worry about 
interfaces and protocols.
